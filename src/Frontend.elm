Elm Camp brings an opportunity for Elm makers & tool builders to gather, communicate and collaborate. Our goal is to strengthen and sustain the Elm ecosystem and community.

Elm Camp is an event geared towards reconnecting in-person and collaborating on the current and future community landscape of the Elm ecosystem that surrounds the Elm core language.

Over the last few years, Elm has seen community-driven tools and libraries expanding the potential and utility of the Elm language, stemming from a steady pace of continued commercial and hobbyist adoption.

There is great potential for progress and innovation in a creative, focused, in-person gathering. It’s been a long while since we’ve had this opportunity for folks who are investing in the future of Elm. We expect the wider community and practitioners to benefit from this collaborative exploration of our problems and goals.

Elm Camp is now in its second year! Following last year’s delightful debut in Denmark, we’re heading to the UK. Our plan is to keep it small, casual and low-stress but we’ve added a day and found a venue that will accommodate more people. This time we’re serious about the camping too!
# Help us plan Elm Camp 2024!

We're still working out the details for Elm Camp 2024. We're on the hunt for a new venue, and we need your help! If you have ideas for a local (to you) venue, please take a few minutes to fill out our [venue survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSemvyUQURU_Dowyvp-5K6miBve5KWjoVTb9D65w82lrPpnBIg)

# Unconference Format

## First and foremost, there are no unchangeable rules, with the exception of the "rule of two feet":
### It is expected that people move freely between sessions at any time. If you are no longer interested in listening or contributing to the conversation, find another one.

<br/>

> <br/>
> You know how at a conference, the best discussions often occur when people are relaxed during coffee breaks? That's the whole idea of an unconference: it's like a long, informal coffee break where everyone can contribute to the conversation. The participants drive the agenda. Any structure that exists at an unconference is just there to kick things off and to help the conversations flow smoothly, not to restrict or dictate the topics.

<br/>
<br/>

## We are doing this together.
## The following is intended as a collective starting point.

# Plan

## Before Elm Camp

- People can start proposing presentations before Elm camp in the form of cards on a Trello board which will be a place for conversations and serve as a schedule during the unconference and an archive after.
- There are 2 pre-planned sessions (the unkeynotes at the start and end of Elm Camp)
- We'll start with 3 tracks. If needed, more concurrent sessions may be scheduled during the unconference.
- Sessions will be offered in 15 and 30 minute blocks.
- We encourage attendees to think about how they might like to document or share our discussions with the community after Elm Camp. e.g. blog posts, graphics, videos

## During Elm Camp

- We'll arrange collective scheduling sessions every morning, where together we pitch, vote for and schedule sessions.
- All tracks will run in sync to allow for easy switching between sessions.
- We'll have reserved time for public announcements. You'll have a couple minutes on stage if needed.
- The schedule will be clearly displayed both online and at the venue for easy reference.
- Session locations will have distinctive names for effortless navigation.
- Session endings will be made clear to prevent overruns.
- Doors will be kept open to make moving along easy.
- Breaks are scheduled to provide downtime.
- The organisers will be readily available and identifiable for any assistance needed.

# Guidelines

## Be inclusive

- There is no restriction or theme on the subject for proposed topics, except that they should be with positive intent. Think do no harm and don't frame your session negatively. A simple, open question is best.
- If you want to talk about something and someone here wants to talk with you about it, grab some space and make it happen. You don't need permission, but keep it open to everyone and don't disrupt running sessions.
- Think of it as a gathering of people having open conversations
- Think discussion: talk _with_, not talk _at_. Share a 20-second description of what you think would be interesting to talk about and why.
- As much as possible, the organisers want to be normal session participants. We're one of you.
- People will be freely moving in and out of sessions. If you find yourself in an empty room, migrate.
- The event has some fixed infrastructure to keep the environment positive. But outside of that if you want to change something, feel free to make it happen.

## What happens here, stays here, by default.

- Assume people are comfortable saying stuff here because it's not going on twitter, so if you do want to quote someone during or after Elm Camp, please get their permission.
- Any outputs from the event should focus on the ideas, initiatives and projects discussed, as opposed to personal opinons or statements by individuals.

# Code of Conduct

Elm Camp welcomes people with a wide range of backgrounds, experiences and knowledge. We can learn a lot from each other. It's important for us to make sure the environment where these discussions happen is inclusive and supportive. Everyone should feel comfortable to participate! The following guidelines are meant to codify these intentions.

## Help everyone feel welcome at Elm Camp

Everyone at Elm Camp is part of Elm Camp. There are a few staff on call and caterers preparing food, but there are no other guests on the grounds.

We expect everyone here to ensure that our community is harrassment-free for everyone.

### Examples of behaviours that help us to provide an an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologising to those affected by our mistakes
* Learning from our and others' mistakes and not repeating negative behaviour
* Focusing on what is best for the overall community, not just ourselves as individuals
* Consider sharing your pronouns when introducing yourself, even if you think they are obvious
* Respect the name and pronouns others introduce themselves with
* When discussing code, avoid criticising the person who wrote the code or referring to the quality of the code in a negative way
* Leave silences to allow everyone a chance to speak
* When standing around talking, leave space for new people to join your converation (sometimes referred to pacman shape)
* If you think something you are about to say might be offensive, consider not saying it. If you need to say it, please warn people beforehand.


### Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Public or private harassment of any kind including offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, politics, or religion
* The use of sexualised language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Interrupting people when they are speaking
* Sharing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting


## Guidelines for running a camp session

As a facilitator it's important that you not only follow our code of conduct, but also help to enforce it.

If you have any concerns when planning, during or after your session, please get in touch with one of the organisers so we can help you.


## Talk to us

If you experience any behaviours or atmosphere at Elm Camp that feels contrary to these values, please let us know. We want everyone to feel safe, equal and welcome.

* Email the organiser team: [team@elm.camp](mailto:team@elm.camp)
* Contact Katja on [Elm slack](https://elm-lang.org/community/slack): @katjam or [Elmcraft Discord](https://discord.gg/QeZDXJrN78): Katja#0091

## How we handle Code of Conduct issues

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. You can make a report personally, anonymously or ask someone to do it on your behalf.

The Code of Conduct is in place to protect everyone at Elm Camp. If any participant violates these rules the organisers will take action.

We prefer to resolve things collaboratively and listening to everyone involved. We can all learn things from each other if we discuss issues openly.

However, if you feel you want help resolving something more privately, please ask an organiser. We are here to support you. The organisers will never disclose who brought the matter to our attention, in the case that they prefer to remain anonymous.

Where appropriate, we aim to be forgiving: if it seems like someone has made a good-natured mistake, we want to give space to grow and learn and a chance to apologise.

Where deemed necessary, the organisers will ask participants who harm the Elm Camp community to leave. This Code of Conduct is a guide, and since we can’t possibly write down all the ways you can hurt people, we may ask participants to leave for reasons that we didn’t write down explicitly here.

If you have any questions, concerns or suggestions regarding this policy, please get in touch.

This code of conduct was inspired by the [!!Con code of conduct](https://bangbangcon.com/conduct.html) and drafted with the guidance of the [Geek Feminism Wiki](https://geekfeminism.fandom.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy_resources)
